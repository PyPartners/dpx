## ✅ Code Guidelines

* Use Python 3.8+ features (e.g., type hints).
* Write clean, readable code with meaningful variable names.
* Follow PEP8 formatting standards.
* Include docstrings and inline comments where helpful.
* For new problems:

  * Provide both memoization and tabulation if applicable.
  * Include time and space complexity in the explanation.
  * Provide a naive version for comparison (if relevant).
  * Prefer educational clarity over compactness.
