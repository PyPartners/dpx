# DPX - Dynamic Programming Examples & Explanations

Welcome to **DPX**, your go-to repository for learning and practicing dynamic programming (DP) concepts through well-explained problems and solutions.

---

## ü§î What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic programming is a powerful algorithmic technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems, solving each subproblem just once, and storing their solutions ‚Äî usually using a table ‚Äî to avoid redundant computations. It is especially useful for optimization problems and problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure properties.

You will learn when to apply DP, such as in problems involving sequences, subsets, and resource allocation, where naive recursive approaches would be too slow.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By studying the examples and explanations in this repository, you will:

- Understand the core concepts of dynamic programming, including memoization and tabulation.
- Learn to identify problems that can be solved using DP.
- Gain practical experience implementing classical DP algorithms like Fibonacci sequence and 0/1 Knapsack.
- Analyze the time and space complexity improvements over naive recursive solutions.
- Build a foundation to tackle more advanced DP problems confidently.
