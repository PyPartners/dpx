## üìÇ Repository Structure

This repo currently contains the following folders:

- **explanations/**  
  Markdown files that explain classic dynamic programming problems, including theory and approach.  
  - [`fibonacci.md`](https://github.com/PyPartners/dpx/blob/main/explanations/fibonacci.md) - Explanation of the Fibonacci sequence using DP.  
  - [`knapsack_01.md`](https://github.com/PyPartners/dpx/blob/main/explanations/knapsack_01.md) - Explanation of the 0/1 Knapsack problem.

- **problems/**  
  Python implementations of the corresponding problems described in the explanations folder.  
  - [`fibonacci.py`](https://github.com/PyPartners/dpx/blob/main/problems/fibonacci.py) - DP solution for the Fibonacci sequence.  
  - [`knapsack_01.py`](https://github.com/PyPartners/dpx/blob/main/problems/knapsack_01.py) - DP solution for the 0/1 Knapsack problem.
